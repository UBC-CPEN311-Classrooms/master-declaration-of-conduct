DECLARATION OF COMMUNICATION DURING CPEN311 FINAL EXAM
======================================================

For each final exam task listed below, answer the statement below.

MY FINAL EXAM SOLUTION FOR THE TASKs SHOULD BE GIVEN A GRADE OF 0 BECAUSE I
COMMUNICATED ABOUT THE TASK WITH ANOTHER PERSON DURING THE FINAL EXAM. FOR
TASKS I HAVE MARKED UNSURE, THE INSTRUCTOR WILL DECIDE BASED ON EVIDENCE AT
HAND.

I communicated regarding Task1: NO
I communicated regarding Task2: NO
I communicated regarding Task3: NO
I communicated regarding Task4: NO
I communicated regarding Task5: NO
I communicated regarding Task6: NO

Name:  (your name)
Student Number: (your number)


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1. The only acceptable responses above are YES, NO, or UNSURE.

2. If you did NOT communicate with anyone, you should leave NO in the declaration.

3. If you did not answer a task, leave the default answer of NO.

4. If your answer is NO for all tasks, please do not submit a declaration.

5. If you DID communicate with one or more people, either directly or
indirectly as a sender or recipient or both, then change the NO to YES.

6. If you did communicate on some tasks, but are not sure which ones, then
write YES for the ones you are sure about and UNSURE for the ones you are
uncertain about.  For the tasks marked UNSURE, the instructor will determine
whether the task will be considered YES or NO based on the evidence at hand.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

The final exam was held on 13 December 2024. It started at 08:30am and ended at
12:15pm because some students have extended time to write. Any communication
within this time window is forbidden. If you communicated after you completed
your exam, but before the other party finished their exam, then you are still
considered to have participated in cheating.

Note that communication may have been either direct (eg, email/chat) or
indirect (eg, shared files).

By admitting to communication for a task as YES or UNSURE, you will receive no
further penalties other than a grade of 0 for this task.

By admitting to commmunication for one or more tasks, special consideration
will be made to determine whether your remaining grade is a pass or fail. In
some circumstances, you might still pass the course even though your grade has
been reduced.

If there is any evidence of cheating for a task, but you have answered NO, then
the case will be escalated through the normal UBC process.  The typical penalty
is 0 on the entire exam, thereby failing the course.
